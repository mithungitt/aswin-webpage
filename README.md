# Aswin's Webpage
So far I have incorporated all the things you have asked. Although the work is not perfected and completely done, a chunk has been done.
You can add the information you need in the `<p>` tags within the html code, dont worry about the formatting and allignment, just focus on giving all the information required to be filled in.
I shall later on edit the page with everything you added to make it uniform.

## To Run
- The file where I've made the main page is webpage.html
- you can use `live server` to run the page on VS code


## research cards
- This page contains the 4 cards you asked for with title and subtitle

## CV containers
-this page has 4divs in which you can add the information 

## Things to work on
- To make the styling uniform after inclusion of data
- To make required changes that client wants in the further stages
- To make the final product responsive and suitable for mobile view
